# 🚀 OIBSIP - Data Science Internship
This repository contains all the tasks completed during the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**.  
The internship focused on hands-on machine learning, data analysis, and model building.

Below are the three projects completed during the internship:

---

## 📁 **Task 1 — Iris Flower Classification**
A supervised machine learning project that predicts the species of an iris flower based on:

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

### ✔ Techniques Used:
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Data Visualization  
- Classification Metrics  

📂 Folder: `Task-1-Iris-Classification/`  
📘 Notebook: `OIBSIP_Task1_Iris_Classification.ipynb`

## 📁 **Task 2 — Unemployment Analysis**
An analytical project exploring unemployment trends using real-world data.

### ✔ Includes:
- Dataset cleaning  
- Handling missing values  
- Visualization (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps)  
- Trend identification
